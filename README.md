## Documentation

Fixing the compatability issues with Mokku -> in comes Mokcha

Test, Debug and Mock API calls all from a simple chrome extension.

This was specifically created to be an up to date and working api interceptor.

**Saving Your Api Mocks to the cloud (firebase) coming soon**

## Why use Mokcha

This extension is fully open source and will be updated to make sure it still works with new chrome updates

## Development Setup

This is almost finished and ready to be deployed into the chrome app store, but you can use it and test it out locally now

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project

Install React globally:

```
npm install -g @react
```

Install NPM packages / dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run the development server

```
cd mokcha
npm run start
```

Tip: when trying to develop to use the chrome object you must use this command

```
npm install @types/chrome --save-dev
```

### MACOS Users

You might have to either enable permissions for your project directory for vscode (or your editor)

Otherwise you will get access error. Also if NPM is giving you issues in the terminal make sure you run the command as 

``sudo npm [blah blah]``

so you run as administrator.
