# Mokcha

Out with mokku (which doesnt work half the time) - in with Mokcha. 

Test, Debug and Mock API calls all from a simple chrome extension.

This was specifically created to be an up to date and working api interceptor.

### In Dev Mode

you can run this just like a normal react application

when trying to develop to use the chrome object you must use this command

```npm install @types/chrome --save-dev```
