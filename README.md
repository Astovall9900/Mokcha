Fixing the compatability issues with Mokku -> in comes Mokcha

Test, Debug and Mock API calls all from a simple chrome extension.

This was specifically created to be an up to date and working api interceptor.

### In Dev Mode

you can run this just like a normal react application

Tip: when trying to develop to use the chrome object you must use this command

```npm install @types/chrome --save-dev```
